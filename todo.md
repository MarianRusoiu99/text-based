- **Provider-Agnostic Design**: Abstract all external dependencies
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow single responsibility and dependency inversion
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code around business domains

### Quality Standards
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% for services, 70% overall
- **Security**: Implement OWASP guidelines and regular audits
- **Performance**: Optimize for scalability and user experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user interfaces

### Technology Stack Compliance
- **Backend**: NestJS 10+, TypeScript 5+, Prisma 5+, PostgreSQL 15+
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript 5+, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, Supertest
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Redis, cloud-native services

### Success Criteria
- All features fully implemented and tested
- Performance benchmarks met (response times <200ms)
- Security audit passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- 95%+ test coverage across all modules
- Full documentation and API specifications complete
