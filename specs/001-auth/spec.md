# Feature Specification: Authentication & User Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-auth`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Derived from API Design, API Design Specification, Testing docs

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input → Auth with JWT, email verification, password reset
2. Extract key concepts → registration, login, refresh, logout, verify email, forgot/reset password, profile
3. Ambiguities → None; tokens expirations configurable; lockout thresholds TBD
4. Fill scenarios & tests
5. Generate functional requirements
6. Identify entities → User, Session/Token (refresh), VerificationToken, ResetToken
7. Review checklist
```

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a user, I can register, verify my email, log in, refresh tokens, manage my profile, and reset my password securely, with rate limits and clear error messages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a new email and username, when I register with a strong password, then I receive a verification email and cannot log in until verified.
2. Given a verified account, when I log in with correct credentials, then I receive `accessToken` and `refreshToken` and can call protected endpoints.
3. Given a valid refresh token, when I call refresh, then I get a new access token and rotated refresh token.
4. Given an active session, when I logout, then the refresh token becomes invalid and subsequent refresh fails.
5. Given an email, when I request password reset, then I receive a reset link; when I submit a strong new password with the token, then the password is updated and old sessions are invalidated.
6. Given rate limits, when I exceed login attempts, then my account is temporarily locked per policy and I receive an appropriate error.

### Edge Cases
- Duplicate username/email registration → 409 with specific error code.
- Expired verification/reset token → 400 with actionable message.
- Using unverified account for login → 403 `USER_NOT_VERIFIED`.
- Password policy violations → 422 detailed validation errors.
- Refresh token reuse detection → revoke all sessions for the user.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST allow user registration with validation and sanitization.
- FR-002: System MUST send email verification using provider-agnostic email service.
- FR-003: System MUST prevent login until email verified.
- FR-004: System MUST generate JWT access and refresh tokens with configurable expiry.
- FR-005: System MUST implement refresh token rotation and invalidation on logout.
- FR-006: System MUST enforce rate limiting on auth endpoints and lockout after N failed attempts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: lockout threshold and window].
- FR-007: System MUST support forgot/reset password with secure, time-limited tokens.
- FR-008: System MUST provide profile read/update for authenticated users.
- FR-009: All responses MUST follow `{ success, message, data }` envelope.
- FR-010: All auth operations MUST be audited (security logs without PII).

### Key Entities
- User: id, username, email, passwordHash, displayName, isVerified, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt, lastLogin
- RefreshToken: id, userId, tokenHash, expiresAt, revokedAt, metadata
- VerificationToken: id, userId, tokenHash, expiresAt, usedAt
- PasswordResetToken: id, userId, tokenHash, expiresAt, usedAt
