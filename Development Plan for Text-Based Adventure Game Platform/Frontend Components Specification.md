# Frontend Components Specification

## Component Architecture Principles

### Component Design Philosophy
All components follow a consistent design philosophy emphasizing reusability, accessibility, and maintainability. Components are built using TypeScript for type safety and follow React best practices including proper prop validation, error boundaries, and performance optimization.

### Atomic Design Methodology
Components are organized using atomic design principles with atoms (basic UI elements), molecules (combinations of atoms), organisms (complex UI sections), templates (page layouts), and pages (complete interfaces).

### Accessibility First
All components implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high contrast mode compatibility.

### Responsive Design
Components are built mobile-first with responsive breakpoints and touch-friendly interactions. All components work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Performance Optimization
Components implement performance best practices including proper memoization, lazy loading, virtual scrolling for large lists, and efficient re-rendering strategies.
