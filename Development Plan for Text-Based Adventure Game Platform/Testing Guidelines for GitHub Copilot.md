# Testing Guidelines for GitHub Copilot

## Testing Philosophy and Strategy

This text-based adventure platform follows a comprehensive testing strategy that ensures reliability, maintainability, and user satisfaction through automated testing at multiple levels. The testing approach emphasizes test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD), and continuous integration practices.

### Testing Pyramid Implementation

The testing strategy follows the testing pyramid with a strong foundation of unit tests, comprehensive integration tests, and focused end-to-end tests:

**Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated tests that verify individual functions, components, and services in isolation. These tests run quickly and provide immediate feedback during development.

**Integration Tests (20%)**: Tests that verify the interaction between different components, services, and external dependencies. These tests ensure that modules work correctly together.

**End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Tests that verify complete user workflows from the user interface through the entire system. These tests ensure that the application works correctly from the user's perspective.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All new features must be developed using TDD principles:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired functionality
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

**TDD Benefits:**
- Ensures comprehensive test coverage from the start
- Drives better design decisions through testability requirements
- Provides immediate feedback during development
- Creates living documentation through test specifications
- Reduces debugging time and production issues

**TDD Implementation:**
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Focus on behavior rather than implementation details
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Keep tests simple and focused on single responsibilities
- Refactor both production and test code for maintainability

## Backend Testing Strategy
