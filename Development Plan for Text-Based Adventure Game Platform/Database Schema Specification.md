# Database Schema Specification

## Schema Design Principles

### Normalization and Relationships
The database follows third normal form (3NF) principles while allowing strategic denormalization for performance optimization. All relationships use foreign keys with appropriate cascade options to maintain referential integrity.

### UUID Primary Keys
All tables use UUID primary keys to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems and prevent enumeration attacks. UUIDs are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators.

### Audit Trail and Timestamps
All tables include created_at and updated_at timestamps for audit purposes. Soft deletes are implemented for critical data using deleted_at columns with appropriate indexes.

### Flexible Data Storage
JSONB columns are used for semi-structured data that requires flexibility, such as RPG mechanics configurations, node content, and user preferences. This allows for schema evolution without migrations while maintaining query performance through GIN indexes.

### Performance Optimization
Strategic indexing is implemented for all frequently queried columns with composite indexes for complex queries. Partial indexes are used for filtered queries to optimize storage and performance.
