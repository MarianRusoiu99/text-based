# Architecture Specification

## System Overview

The text-based adventure platform is built using a modern, scalable architecture that emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and provider-agnostic design. The system consists of a NestJS backend with Prisma ORM, a React frontend with TypeScript, and flexible RPG mechanics integration throughout all layers that allows story creators to define their own game systems.

## Core Architectural Principles

### Provider-Agnostic Design
All external service integrations must be implemented through abstract interfaces that allow easy swapping of providers without changing business logic. This includes storage providers (AWS S3, MinIO, local storage), logging providers (Winston, Pino, console), email providers (SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP), and caching providers (Redis, Memcached, in-memory).

### Modular Architecture
The system is organized into feature modules that encapsulate related functionality. Each module contains controllers, services, DTOs, and other components specific to that feature domain. Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces and dependency injection.

### Domain-Driven Design
The codebase follows domain-driven design principles with clear separation between business logic, infrastructure concerns, and presentation layers. Domain entities are rich objects that encapsulate business rules and behavior.

### SOLID Principles
All code must adhere to SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. This ensures maintainable, testable, and extensible code.

### DRY Principle
Don't Repeat Yourself principle must be strictly enforced throughout the codebase. Common functionality must be extracted into reusable components, services, and utilities to minimize code duplication and improve maintainability.

```

### Provider Abstraction Pattern
All external services must be accessed through abstract interfaces that define the contract without specifying implementation details. This allows for easy testing with mock implementations and flexible deployment with different service providers.

Provider interfaces must be defined in the common/providers directory with concrete implementations in separate modules. The dependency injection system must be configured to select the appropriate implementation based on environment configuration.

### Data Access Layer
The data access layer uses Prisma as the primary ORM with repository pattern implementation for complex business logic. All database operations must be type-safe and use transactions where appropriate for data consistency.

Database schema must be designed to support flexible RPG mechanics through JSONB fields that can accommodate any type of game system defined by story creators. The schema must be normalized for performance while maintaining flexibility for custom mechanics.

### API Layer
The API layer follows RESTful principles with comprehensive input validation, error handling, and response formatting. All endpoints must include proper authentication and authorization checks based on user roles and resource ownership.

API documentation must be automatically generated using OpenAPI/Swagger with comprehensive examples and error response documentation. Rate limiting must be implemented to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate usage patterns.

└── utils/                  # Utility functions
```

### State Management Strategy
State management must be organized by feature domain with clear separation between local component state, feature state, and global application state. Server state must be managed separately from client state using appropriate caching and synchronization strategies.

Global state must be minimized and only used for truly global concerns like authentication, user preferences, and cross-feature communication. Feature-specific state must be encapsulated within feature modules.

### Component Design Principles
Components must follow atomic design principles with clear hierarchy from atoms to pages. Each component must have a single responsibility and be reusable across different contexts where appropriate.

Component props must be strongly typed with TypeScript interfaces. Components must be accessible and follow WCAG guidelines for inclusive design. Performance must be optimized through appropriate use of memoization and lazy loading.

## RPG Mechanics Architecture

### Template System Design
The RPG template system must be completely flexible to accommodate any type of game mechanics that story creators might want to implement. Templates must define the structure and rules for character stats, proficiencies, items, and custom game logic without hardcoding specific implementations.

Template storage must use flexible data structures that can accommodate various data types and complex relationships. Template validation must ensure consistency and completeness while allowing maximum creative freedom for story creators.

### Mechanics Engine
The mechanics engine must be generic and configurable based on RPG template definitions. It must support various types of checks, calculations, and conditional logic without being tied to specific game systems.

The engine must be performant and scalable to handle complex calculations and large numbers of simultaneous players. Error handling must be robust with clear feedback for both players and creators when issues occur.

### Character System
The character system must be flexible enough to represent any type of character that might be defined in an RPG template. Character data must be stored in a way that allows for efficient querying and updating while maintaining data integrity.

Character progression must be configurable based on template definitions with support for various advancement systems. Character state must be properly managed during gameplay with appropriate persistence and synchronization.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization
Authentication must use industry-standard practices with secure token management and session handling. Multi-factor authentication must be supported for enhanced security.

Authorization must be role-based with fine-grained permissions that can be configured per resource and operation. All API endpoints must include proper authorization checks with clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts.

### Data Protection
All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Personal information must be handled in compliance with privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA.

Input validation must be comprehensive and applied at all entry points to prevent injection attacks and data corruption. Output encoding must be used to prevent XSS attacks and data leakage.

### Security Monitoring
Security monitoring must be implemented to detect and respond to potential threats including brute force attacks, suspicious activity patterns, and potential data breaches.

Audit logging must track all security-relevant operations with sufficient detail for forensic analysis while protecting user privacy. Security alerts must be configured for critical events with appropriate escalation procedures.

## Performance and Scalability

### Caching Strategy
Caching must be implemented at multiple levels including application-level caching, database query caching, and CDN caching for static assets. Cache invalidation must be intelligent and efficient to maintain data consistency.

Cache providers must be abstracted to allow for different implementations in different environments. Cache performance must be monitored with appropriate metrics and alerting.

### Database Optimization
Database performance must be optimized through appropriate indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling. Database scaling must be supported through read replicas and other scaling techniques.

Database monitoring must track performance metrics with alerting for performance degradation. Database maintenance must be automated where possible with proper backup and recovery procedures.

### Application Scaling
The application must be designed for horizontal scaling with stateless components and proper load balancing. Auto-scaling must be supported based on performance metrics and traffic patterns.

Performance monitoring must track application metrics with alerting for performance issues. Performance testing must be conducted regularly to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

## Testing Architecture

### Testing Strategy
Testing must be comprehensive with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests covering all critical functionality. Test coverage must meet minimum thresholds with quality gates preventing deployment of inadequately tested code.

Testing must be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with fast feedback for developers. Test data management must be automated with proper setup and teardown procedures.

### Test Organization
Tests must be organized by feature domain with clear separation between different types of tests. Test utilities and fixtures must be reusable across different test suites to minimize duplication.

Test environments must closely mirror production environments to ensure test reliability. Test execution must be parallelized for fast feedback while maintaining test isolation.

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization
The application must be containerized using Docker with multi-stage builds for optimized production images. Container security must be implemented with vulnerability scanning and minimal base images.

Container orchestration must support scaling and high availability with proper health checks and restart policies. Container monitoring must track resource usage and performance metrics.

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline must automate testing, building, and deployment with proper quality gates and approval processes. Deployment must support multiple environments with environment-specific configurations.

Pipeline security must include secret management and access controls. Pipeline monitoring must track deployment success rates and performance metrics.

### Infrastructure Management
Infrastructure must be managed as code with version control and automated provisioning. Infrastructure must be designed for high availability with proper redundancy and failover procedures.

Infrastructure monitoring must track system health and performance with automated alerting and escalation. Infrastructure security must include network security, access controls, and compliance monitoring.

This architecture specification provides the foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and secure text-based adventure platform that can adapt to various RPG mechanics while maintaining high performance and user experience standards.
