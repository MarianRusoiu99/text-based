# Testing Strategy Specification

## Testing Philosophy and Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All development follows test-driven development principles where tests are written before implementation. This ensures comprehensive test coverage, better design decisions, and more maintainable code. The TDD cycle includes writing failing tests, implementing minimal code to pass tests, and refactoring for quality.

### Testing Pyramid
The testing strategy follows the testing pyramid with a strong foundation of unit tests, comprehensive integration tests, and focused end-to-end tests. This approach ensures fast feedback loops, reliable test execution, and efficient debugging when issues arise.

### Quality Gates
All code changes must pass comprehensive quality gates including unit tests, integration tests, code coverage thresholds, security scans, and performance benchmarks before merging to main branches.

### Continuous Testing
Tests are executed continuously throughout the development process with automated test runs on every commit, pull request, and deployment. This ensures early detection of issues and maintains code quality standards.
