# API Design Specification

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Design
All APIs follow REST principles with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and resource-based URLs. Resources are nouns, and actions are represented by HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).

### Consistent Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent structure with success indicators, data payload, error information, and metadata including pagination and request tracking information.

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500)
- Provide clear error messages with actionable information
- Include error codes for programmatic handling
- Log all errors with sufficient context for debugging

### Validation and Security
- Validate all input data using DTOs with class-validator
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Use proper authentication and authorization

### Provider-Agnostic Design
API design must not expose implementation details of specific providers. All external service interactions must be abstracted through internal interfaces that can be swapped without changing API contracts.

## Authentication Endpoints

### POST /auth/register

**Request Validation:**
- Username must be unique, 3-50 characters, alphanumeric and underscore only
- Email must be valid format and unique in the system
- Password must meet security requirements: minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Display name is optional, maximum 100 characters
- All fields must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks

**Security Considerations:**
- Implement rate limiting to prevent automated registration abuse
- Use secure password hashing with appropriate salt rounds
- Send email verification with secure, time-limited tokens
- Log registration attempts for security monitoring
