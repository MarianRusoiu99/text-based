### Component Design Principles

The frontend follows atomic design principles with a clear hierarchy of components:

**Atoms**: Basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, and icons that cannot be broken down further.

**Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms that function together as a unit, such as form fields with labels and validation messages.

**Organisms**: Complex UI components that combine molecules and atoms to form distinct sections of an interface, like navigation bars or story node editors.

**Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.

**Pages**: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content.

## Story Editor Interface

### Node-Based Canvas

The story editor features a visual, node-based interface inspired by workflow tools like N8N, providing an intuitive way for authors to create complex branching narratives.
