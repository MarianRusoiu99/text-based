# Backend Architecture for Text-Based Adventure Platform

## Overview

The backend architecture is built using NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework that provides a robust foundation for building scalable server-side applications with flexible RPG mechanics support. The architecture emphasizes modularity, reusability, and maintainability through dependency injection, decorators, and a clear separation of concerns. A key architectural principle is provider-agnostic design, allowing easy swapping of external services like storage, logging, and email providers. Prisma serves as the database toolkit, providing type-safe database access and automated migrations.

## Provider-Agnostic Architecture

### Abstract Service Interfaces

The backend implements abstract interfaces for all external dependencies, enabling easy provider switching and testing:

**Storage Provider Interface**: Defines methods for file upload, download, deletion, and URL generation. Implementations can include AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO, or local filesystem storage.

**Email Provider Interface**: Defines methods for sending transactional emails, templates, and bulk communications. Implementations can include SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, or SMTP servers.

**Logging Provider Interface**: Defines methods for structured logging, error tracking, and performance monitoring. Implementations can include Winston, Pino, console logging, or cloud logging services.

**Cache Provider Interface**: Defines methods for key-value caching, session storage, and distributed caching. Implementations can include Redis, Memcached, or in-memory caching.
