# Technical Specifications for Text-Based Adventure Platform

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to create a 2-in-1 platform for text-based adventure games, combining a story creation tool with a story player. The platform will allow users to create interactive stories using a node-based interface and play stories in a light novel style. It will also include social features for sharing, rating, and browsing stories, along with analytics for story creators.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Story Maker (Editor)

*   **Node-based Interface:** Each node represents a story step or chapter.

    *   **Background:** Image or video URL for the scene background.
    *   **Choices:** Multiple options leading to different nodes.
    *   **Inventory Interactions:** Ability to give/take items, and check if the player possesses a specific item.
    *   **Flags:** Custom boolean values for conditional logic within the story.
    *   **Position:** {x, y} coordinates for node layout in the editor.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Live preview of the story (simulate play mode).
    *   Save, publish, and share stories.

### 2.2. Player (Reader)

*   **Interface:** Light novel style display.
*   **Content Display:**
    *   Text paragraphs shown sequentially.
    *   Character sprites and backgrounds displayed with animations.
    *   Choices appear inline.

    *   Optional: Achievements and ending statistics.

### 2.3. Social & User Management

*   **User Accounts:**
    *   Registration and login (email/password, OAuth optional).
    *   JWT tokens for authentication.
    *   Password hashing (bcrypt).
*   **User Profiles:** Avatar, bio, list of created and played stories.
*   **Story Browsing:** Browse stories by category, popularity, or tags.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Rating and commenting system (1-5 stars).
    *   Story sharing via link.
    *   Public or private story settings.

### 2.4. Analytics & Stats (For Story Creators)

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Number of reads.
    *   Average ratings.
    *   Choice selection statistics.
    *   Completion rates.
*   **Dashboard:** Creator dashboard to view statistics.
*   **Export:** Option to download stats (CSV).

## 3. Technical Stack Recommendations

### 3.1. Frontend

*   **Framework:** React + TypeScript.
*   **Node Editor:** React Flow (for drag-and-drop graph editor).
*   **State Management:** Zustand (lightweight, easy).
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion (for characters/backgrounds).
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS.
*   **Asset Management:** Local development: public folder; Production: AWS S3 / DigitalOcean Spaces.

### 3.2. Backend

*   **Language/Framework:** Node.js + NestJS (modular, scalable).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational, good for stories, choices, users).
*   **ORM:** Prisma (Type-safe, easy migrations).
*   **Authentication:** JWT + bcrypt.
*   **File Storage:** AWS S3 / DigitalOcean Spaces for assets (backgrounds, character sprites).
*   **API:** REST endpoints (GraphQL optional for advanced querying).

### 3.3. Infrastructure

*   **Hosting:**
    *   Frontend: Vercel.
    *   Backend: Railway / Render / AWS EC2.
*   **Containerization:** Docker (Containerize frontend, backend, and DB).
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (for building & deployment).
*   **Monitoring:** Sentry + LogRocket.
*   **CDN:** Cloudflare (for fast asset delivery).
*   **Realtime (optional for collaborative editing):** WebSockets / Firebase Realtime Database.

## 4. Development Phases (High-Level)

*   **Phase 1: MVP** (User accounts, basic editor, linear player, save/load).
*   **Phase 2: Advanced Story Features** (Conditional logic, character/background management, multiple endings, preview).
*   **Phase 3: Social & Sharing** (Browse, search, rate, user profiles, shareable links).
*   **Phase 4: Analytics & Stats** (Reads, ratings, choice stats, creator dashboard).
*   **Phase 5: Polish & Scale** (Cloud storage, CDN, CI/CD, error monitoring, performance optimization).

## 5. Modularity, Reusability, and Maintainability

Throughout the development, emphasis will be placed on creating a modular, reusable, and easy-to-maintain codebase. This will be achieved through:

*   **Clear Module Separation:** Dividing the application into distinct, independent modules (e.g., user module, story module, analytics module).
*   **Component-Based Frontend:** Utilizing React's component-based architecture for reusable UI elements.
*   **Service-Oriented Backend:** Designing backend services with clear responsibilities and interfaces.
*   **Type-Safety:** Leveraging TypeScript and Prisma for robust and error-resistant code.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Consistent Coding Standards:** Adhering to established coding guidelines and best practices.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintaining up-to-date documentation for all modules and APIs.
