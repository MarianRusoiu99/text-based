# Technical Specifications for Text-Based Adventure Platform

## 1. Project Overview

The project aims to create a 2-in-1 platform for text-based adventure games, combining a powerful story creation tool with an immersive story player. The platform will allow users to create interactive stories with deep RPG mechanics, inspired by classic tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, using a node-based interface. Players will experience these stories in a rich, interactive text-based format. The platform will also include social features for sharing, rating, and browsing stories, along with analytics for story creators.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Story Maker (Editor)

*   **Node-based Interface:** Each node represents a story step, event, or chapter. The interface will be intuitive, N8N-like, with expandable nodes to view text and options, and support shortcuts for efficiency.
*   **Node Properties:**
    *   **Text:** Array of paragraphs to display sequentially.
    *   **Characters:** Define characters, their positions (left/center/right), expressions, and animations.
    *   **Background:** Image or video URL for the scene background.
    *   **Choices:** Multiple options leading to different nodes, potentially requiring checks against player stats or inventory.
    *   **Inventory Interactions:** Ability to give/take items, and check if the player possesses a specific item. Supports logical decision-making (e.g., if a key is not in inventory, a different path is taken).
    *   **Flags:** Custom boolean values for conditional logic within the story.
    *   **Position:** {x, y} coordinates for node layout in the editor.
*   **RPG Mechanics Definition:**
    *   **Customizable Stats:** Story creators can define custom player stats (e.g., Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Charisma, Speech, Animal Handling, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom). These stats can be numerical, boolean, or string-based, with configurable default values, min/max ranges, and descriptions. The editor will provide tools to define these stats and their properties.
    *   **Proficiencies:** Story creators can define proficiencies and link them to specific stats. These proficiencies can grant bonuses or unlock special actions during gameplay.
    *   **Skill Checks:** The editor will allow story creators to define skill checks within story nodes. These checks will evaluate a player's character stats and proficiencies against a defined difficulty. The outcome of a successful or failed check can dynamically branch the story to different nodes.
    *   **Custom Game Logic:** Story creators can define custom game logic, such as combat scenarios, damage calculations, or resource management, using a flexible system of variables, formulas, and conditional statements. This allows for highly customizable and unique game mechanics without hardcoding specific systems.
    *   **Reusable Mechanics:** The platform will enable story creators to save and reuse their defined stats, proficiencies, and custom game logic templates across multiple stories, fostering consistency and efficiency.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Live preview of the story (simulate play mode).
    *   Save, publish, and share stories with visibility controls.
    *   Quality of life options and features for intuitive editing.

### 2.2. Player (Reader)

*   **Interface:** Immersive text-based RPG display.
*   **Content Display:**
    *   Text paragraphs shown sequentially.
    *   Character sprites and backgrounds displayed with animations.
    *   Choices appear inline, reflecting the outcomes of stat/proficiency checks.
*   **Game Mechanics:**
    *   Tracks inventory, flags, and player progression.
    *   **Player Stats Display:** An accessible interface to view current player stats, proficiencies, and inventory items.
    *   **Chapter History:** A history log of past choices and narrative events.
    *   Supports multiple endings based on choices, conditions, and stat outcomes.
    *   Optional: Achievements and ending statistics.
*   **Story Structure:** The story works as a finite state automata or a chained list that branches based on actions taken and can also converge.

### 2.3. Social & User Management

*   **User Accounts:**
    *   Registration and login (email/password, OAuth optional).
    *   JWT tokens for authentication.
    *   Password hashing (bcrypt).
*   **User Profiles:** Avatar, bio, list of created and played stories.
*   **Story Browsing:** Browse stories by category, popularity, or tags.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Rating and commenting system (1-5 stars).
    *   Story sharing via link with visibility controls (public, unlisted, private).

### 2.4. Analytics & Stats (For Story Creators)

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Number of reads.
    *   Average ratings.
    *   Choice selection statistics (including outcomes of stat checks).
    *   Completion rates.
*   **Dashboard:** Creator dashboard to view statistics.
*   **Export:** Option to download stats (CSV).

## 3. Technical Stack Recommendations

*   **Component-Based Frontend:** Utilizing React's component-based architecture for reusable UI elements.
*   **Service-Oriented Backend:** Designing backend services with clear responsibilities and interfaces, adhering to the DRY principle.
*   **Provider-Agnostic Design:** Implementing abstractions for external services (storage, logging, email) to allow easy swapping of providers.
*   **Type-Safety:** Leveraging TypeScript and Prisma for robust and error-resistant code.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Playwright for both frontend and backend.
*   **Consistent Coding Standards:** Adhering to established coding guidelines and best practices.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Maintaining up-to-date documentation for all modules and APIs.
