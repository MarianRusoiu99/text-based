# Architecture Principles for GitHub Copilot

## Core Development Philosophy

This text-based adventure platform with flexible RPG mechanics follows strict architectural principles that emphasize modularity, maintainability, scalability, and provider-agnostic design. Every component must be designed with separation of concerns, dependency injection, and clean architecture patterns.

### SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class, module, and service must have one clear responsibility. Services handle business logic, controllers manage HTTP requests, repositories abstract data access, and providers encapsulate external dependencies.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Components must be open for extension but closed for modification. Use interfaces, abstract classes, and dependency injection to enable extensibility without changing existing code.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. All implementations of interfaces must honor the contract defined by the interface.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Create focused, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Implementation

Eliminate code duplication through:
- Shared utility functions and helper classes
- Common base classes for similar functionality
- Reusable components and services
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Template patterns for similar operations

### Provider-Agnostic Architecture

All external dependencies must be abstracted through interfaces:
- Storage providers (file system, S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
- Email providers (SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun, etc.)
- Logging providers (Winston, Pino, console, etc.)
- Cache providers (Redis, Memcached, in-memory, etc.)
- Authentication providers (JWT, OAuth, SAML, etc.)

Each provider category must have:
1. An abstract interface defining the contract
2. Multiple concrete implementations
3. A factory pattern for provider selection
4. Configuration-driven provider switching
5. Default implementations for development

### Modular Design Patterns

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Organize code around business domains (User Management, Story Creation, RPG Template Management, Gameplay) with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces.

**Hexagonal Architecture**: Separate business logic from external concerns through ports and adapters. The core domain logic should be independent of frameworks, databases, and external services.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events for loose coupling between modules. Story progression, RPG mechanics, and user actions should communicate through well-defined events.

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Best Practices

**Strict Type Safety**: Enable strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any, strict null checks, and comprehensive type coverage. All functions must have explicit return types, and all variables must have clear type annotations.

**Interface Design**: Create comprehensive interfaces for all data structures, API contracts, and service boundaries. Use generic types for reusable components and maintain consistent naming conventions.

**Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with typed error objects, proper error boundaries, and consistent error response formats across all layers.

### Testing Requirements

**Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 90% code coverage for backend services and 85% for frontend components. All critical business logic must have 100% coverage.

**Test Organization**: Organize tests by feature domain with clear separation between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.

**Mock Strategy**: Use dependency injection and interface abstractions to enable comprehensive mocking. Mock all external dependencies and focus tests on the component under test.

### Performance Standards

**Database Optimization**: Use appropriate indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data and optimize N+1 query problems.

**Frontend Performance**: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient re-rendering strategies. Use performance monitoring and optimization techniques for large data sets.

**Memory Management**: Implement proper cleanup for event listeners, subscriptions, and resources. Monitor memory usage and implement garbage collection optimization where necessary.

## Security Requirements

### Input Validation and Sanitization

**Comprehensive Validation**: Validate all input data at multiple layers including client-side validation, API validation, and database constraints. Use schema validation libraries for consistent validation rules.

**Sanitization**: Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other security vulnerabilities. Use parameterized queries and prepared statements for database operations.

**Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage. Use different rate limits for different types of operations.

### Authentication and Authorization

**Secure Authentication**: Implement secure authentication with proper password hashing, session management, and multi-factor authentication support. Use secure token generation and validation.

**Role-Based Access Control**: Implement comprehensive authorization with role-based permissions and resource-level access controls. Ensure proper authorization checks on all protected resources.

**Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for all security-relevant operations including authentication, authorization, and data access.

## RPG Mechanics Architecture

### Template System Design

**Flexibility First**: The RPG template system must be completely flexible to accommodate any type of game mechanics that story creators might want to implement. Never hardcode specific game systems or mechanics.

**Data Structure Design**: Use flexible data structures that can accommodate various data types, complex relationships, and custom calculations without requiring schema changes.

**Validation Framework**: Implement a comprehensive validation framework that can validate any type of RPG template while ensuring consistency and completeness.

### Mechanics Engine

**Generic Processing**: The mechanics engine must be generic and configurable based on RPG template definitions. It must support various types of checks, calculations, and conditional logic without being tied to specific game systems.

**Performance Optimization**: Ensure the mechanics engine is performant and scalable to handle complex calculations and large numbers of simultaneous players.

**Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with clear feedback for both players and creators when issues occur in mechanics processing.

### Character System

**Template-Based Design**: The character system must be flexible enough to represent any type of character that might be defined in an RPG template. Character data must be stored in a way that allows for efficient querying and updating.

**Progression Flexibility**: Character progression must be configurable based on template definitions with support for various advancement systems defined by story creators.

**State Management**: Character state must be properly managed during gameplay with appropriate persistence and synchronization across different game sessions.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Standards

**Comprehensive Reviews**: All code changes must undergo thorough code review focusing on architecture compliance, security considerations, performance implications, and maintainability.

**Documentation Requirements**: All public APIs, complex algorithms, and business logic must be thoroughly documented with clear explanations of purpose, parameters, and expected behavior.

**Testing Validation**: All code changes must include appropriate tests with proper coverage and validation of edge cases and error conditions.

### Continuous Integration

**Automated Quality Gates**: Implement comprehensive quality gates including automated testing, code coverage validation, security scanning, and performance benchmarking.

**Environment Consistency**: Ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production with proper configuration management and infrastructure as code.

**Deployment Automation**: Implement automated deployment pipelines with proper rollback capabilities and monitoring integration.

## Error Handling and Logging

### Comprehensive Error Management

**Structured Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling patterns across all layers with proper error classification, logging, and user-friendly error messages.

**Error Recovery**: Implement appropriate error recovery mechanisms including retry logic, fallback strategies, and graceful degradation.

**Monitoring Integration**: Integrate error handling with monitoring and alerting systems to enable proactive issue detection and resolution.

### Logging Strategy

**Structured Logging**: Use structured logging with consistent log formats, appropriate log levels, and comprehensive context information for debugging and monitoring.

**Performance Logging**: Implement performance logging for critical operations with timing information and resource usage metrics.

**Security Logging**: Implement comprehensive security logging for authentication, authorization, and security-relevant operations with proper audit trails.

## Performance and Scalability

### Scalability Design

**Horizontal Scaling**: Design all components to support horizontal scaling with stateless architecture and proper load balancing.

**Database Scaling**: Implement database scaling strategies including read replicas, connection pooling, and query optimization.
